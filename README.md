# Schrödinger PDEs: Numerical solutions and simulations.
Authors: Alejandro Galván, Daniel Quiles and Bernat Ramis - students of Mathematics and Engineering Physics at UPC.

The aim of this work is to investigate the applicability of numerical methods to solve the Schrödinger
partial differential equations. We started by developing two discretized versions of the one-dimensional
equation: the first one according to Euler's method, and the second one with the more stable Crank-
Nicolson method. Later, we also deduced the Crank-Nicolson equations for the case of two spatial
dimensions.

After implementing these methods in Matlab, we began modelling some simple quantum systems. As
we obtained simulations that perfectly matched the theory behind them, we moved on to more difficult
or unconventional systems in the hopes of finding more interesting results, as well as discovering the
strengths and weaknesses of numerical PDE solving.

This repository contains the codes we used in our simulations, some videos of the main results and a pdf with an extensive explanation of our work method and the results obtained.
